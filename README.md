# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:
The Cpu can run RISCV instructions with a two stage pipeline to increase the speed of computation. It can support multiple instructions like loading and storing to memory, adding two registors, and performing logical operations. The pipeline was used so it can perform different operations at different timesteps allowing it to have parrlel operations increasing the processing speed of the cpu. It can run I-Type, B-Type, R-Type, S-Type, U-Type, and J-Type functions.
